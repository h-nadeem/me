TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Week 3: lets do this

---

Useful Info:
searches - binary and linear searches.
binary - more efficient and faster, keeps cutting code in half until the number is found
linear - more time consuming, (e.g. goes through EVERY number in the list until the number is found)

range() - is a function, returns sequence of numbers, starts from 0, increments 1, and stops at a number (specified)
code errors: Logic, syntax, runtime
loops: while, for, repeat until
lists = []
f strings = simplifying strings with 'f'
code golf = use it to help make your code more efficient/least number of lines
append = adding to a list
debugging = when trying to figure out how to debug your work, run the debugging file.

LOGS

# Monday 11:30 AM: i looked at all the files to give me an overview of what i am going to learn this week. Right now, i looked at ex 1,2,3,4 and im now researching what errors there are.

    . logic errors - mathematical/arithmetic mistakes or anything that contains logic really.
    . syntax errors - spelling mistakes/ string mistakes
    . runtime errors - division by zero and running loops (never ending ones i think)

    thats kind of cool. im going to write the basic points of the exercise of what i need to do.

    Exercise 1 - Test passing (learning about while loops & range)

    l1:
    . use a while loop
    . return a list of numbers using while loop
    . figure out the start number, stop number, increment(fancy word for adding) number

    L2:
    . increment by 2 using range (do it from scratch and one using l1)

    L3:
    . OHHHHH YES finally inputs
    . make an input, ask for a number between high and low until it passes

    L4:
    . look for a number in responses, if caught, return the number
    . if there are words or letters, ask again

    L5:
    . combine functions L4 & L3. yuck.

    _______________________________________________________________________________________________________
    Exercise 2 - guessing game

    this one looks so cool

    . figure out what happens if someone answers something out of the range of the code, something the code
    didnt notice.
    . simplify it and make it more robust
