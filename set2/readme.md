TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

def function name(number): 
    answer = number + 1
    return answer

    creates a function that increments the number which is the answer (number+1) and then returns


the_answer = a_string.upper()
    return the_answer

this is for changing the string to upper case. (.lower() if changing to lowercase)

Exercise 3
odd - true or false
if its true or false - its a boolean. so a boolean function is used. i have to try and write out 
a line of code that returns true or false if a number is odd - and that number is given in the test, 2 and 5.

return(bool(a_number % 2 == 0)) - didnt work? idk why, i tested it (maybe bool isnt a correct function?)
i know that this is how its formatted - well im guessing, let me play around with it.

return(bool(a_number % 2 =/= 0)) maybe if its not equal to zero? idk how to type that symbol, let me google it

ok so the operator is (!=)

let me try again.

return(bool(a_number % 2 != 0)) there? lets check. 

it works. i am amazing. 

ok next one.
